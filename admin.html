[Chorus]
Nigga say he want smoke, but really I ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Nothin')
We can make it back home safe, nigga, just don't push my buttons (Don't)
I don't wanna hit none of these hoes raw 'cause I don't wanna worry bout nothin' (Mm-mm)
She want a brand-new Birkin bag, it depend on how she suck it (Yeah)
I'ma bust down my ho, I'ma bust down your bitch (Yeah)
She don't need to drink no more, bad bitches wanna stay lit (Lit)
I got the rizz, she'll do whatever just to get this dick (No cap)
She swallowin' kids with her tongue out and she better not spit (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Bad bitches on my dick, huh
When I walk up in the party, it's at least a couple hoes I done hit, huh
I don't really want nothin' from her, I just wanna cross her off the list, huh
