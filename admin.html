        <p>Huh, huh
Huh, on my shit, on my shit, huh, huh
Okay, okay, okay, huh, huh

[Chorus]
Nigga say he want smoke, but really I ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Nothin')
We can make it back home safe, nigga, just don't push my buttons (Don't)
I don't wanna hit none of these hoes raw 'cause I don't wanna worry bout nothin' (Mm-mm)
She want a brand-new Birkin bag, it depend on how she suck it (Yeah)
I'ma bust down my ho, I'ma bust down your bitch (Yeah)
She don't need to drink no more, bad bitches wanna stay lit (Lit)
I got the rizz, she'll do whatever just to get this dick (No cap)
She swallowin' kids with her tongue out and she better not spit (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Bad bitches on my dick, huh
When I walk up in the party, it's at least a couple hoes I done hit, huh
I don't really want nothin' from her, I just wanna cross her off the list, huh
I can shoot my shot at any woman, on my mama, I'll never miss
I'm that nigga, I admit
Huh, yeah, I just really wanna win, I don't really need friends
Locked in so much, niggas say I'm fake, they don't understand
Jet Wi-Fi fucked, I'ma text you back when a nigga land
Niggas only hit my line when it's for the hoes or a helping hand
If she with me, then she fine, only out in public when I'm with a ten
She a eight or a nine, then I'm masked up, baby, no offense
Paparazzi outside, I don't wanna be on Shade Room again (Huh, huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2]
I been gettin' to the money
Overseas doin' shows, they don't speak no English, but these people love me
Feelin' like I'm on top, can't an NPC tell me nothin'
How the fuck you judgin' me? Nigga, you ain't even got no fuckin' money
How the fuck I'm supposed to—
How the fuck I'm supposed to listen?
I was broke, I had to fix it, huh
I ain't have a pot to piss in, huh
Fake friends, needed distance
Told them niggas I was finna get rich as fuck, they ain't see the vision
"DDG, do you remember me?" I don't know, I think I got dementia
I got money, I got bitches, huh, every day, it feel like Christmas, huh
Stickin' two fingers in that bitch, when she turn around, I'ma sniff it, huh
Fronto on my weed, it's so strong, thought I hit a whippet, huh
When it come to DDG, niggas know I'm always standing on the business, huh
